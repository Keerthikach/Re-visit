A command-line-based revision tracking application designed to help users review past topics periodically. The app stores questions in an SQLite database, tracks when they were added, and sends system notifications to remind users to revisit them after a set interval.

✨ Features
Store Questions & Descriptions: Save topics you want to revise along with optional details.

Automated Review Scheduling: The app tracks when a question was added and prompts a reminder after a set time (e.g., 7 days).

System Notifications: Uses plyer or win10toast to display reminders on the desktop.

SQLite Database Storage: Keeps a structured record of questions and their timestamps.

Easy Fetching & Deletion: View questions due for revision and remove outdated ones.

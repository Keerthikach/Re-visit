# Spaced Repetition Reminder System

This project is a custom-built **Spaced Repetition Reminder System** that intelligently reminds users to review important questions or concepts at optimal intervals to improve long-term retention. It follows the **SM-2 algorithm**, famously used in Anki flashcards, to adaptively schedule reviews based on recall performance.

It combines a lightweight **SQLite** backend, **Windows toast notifications**, and a clean **Streamlit frontend** for a complete offline-first learning tool.

## üß± Project Structure

### üìÅ Database: `rev_questions.db`

The database contains a single table named `tracker_1_1`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tracker_1_1 (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  added_date TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (DATE('now')),
  last_review_date TEXT,
  next_review_date TEXT,
  ease_factor REAL DEFAULT 2.5,
  interval INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  review_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  difficulty TEXT
);
```

Each row represents a reviewable question with:

* `question`: The item to be remembered
* `description`: (Optional) Details or explanation of the question
* `ease_factor`: Adaptive measure (default 2.5) updated after each review
* `interval`: Days until the next review
* `review_count`: Number of times this question was reviewed
* `last_review_date` / `next_review_date`: Used to determine when a reminder is due
* `difficulty`: User-assigned label (Easy / Medium / Hard)

---

## üß† Key Python Modules

### `database.py`

This module handles all interactions with the database and includes the following functions:

#### `init_db()`

Initializes the database and ensures the `tracker_1_1` table exists.

#### `add_questions(question, description, difficulty)`

Inserts a new question into the database with default review scheduling parameters.

#### `fetch_for_rev()`

Returns a list of questions whose `next_review_date` is today or earlier, i.e., due for review.

#### `update_review(quality, question_id)`

Implements the **SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm**:

* Takes user feedback (`quality` score from 0 to 5)
* Updates the `ease_factor`, `interval`, `next_review_date`, and `review_count` based on the SM-2 logic
* Resets the interval if the answer was forgotten (score < 3)

#### `del_entry(question_id)`

Deletes a specific question from the database.

#### `debug_dump()`

Prints the full contents of the table (useful for debugging/testing).

## üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit Frontend

The Streamlit app provides an interactive user interface. On launch, it shows:

### 1. **Add a New Question**

* Text input for the question
* Optional field for description
* Difficulty level selector
* Submit button to add the item to the database

### 2. **Review Questions Due Today**

* Lists all questions fetched via `fetch_for_rev()`
* For each question, displays:

  * The question text
  * Optional description
  * Radio buttons (0-5) to record your recall quality
* On form submission, applies `update_review()` for each reviewed question

---

## üîî Windows Notifications: `reminder.py`

This script runs in the background to show reminders via Windows 10 toast notifications using the `win10toast` library:

* On script execution:

  * Calls `fetch_for_rev()` to find due questions
  * Displays each question as a toast notification

### üîÑ Automation with Windows Task Scheduler

You can schedule `reminder.py` to:

* Run on system login
* Use the correct interpreter (`venv`-based Python 3.11)
* Show toast notifications silently in the background

Configuration tip: Check "Run only when user is logged in" to allow UI interactions (like notifications).

## üìä How SM-2 Algorithm Works

The SM-2 algorithm dynamically adjusts review frequency based on how well you remembered a concept:

| Score | Meaning              | Effect                     |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 5     | Perfect recall       | Increase interval, EF      |
| 4     | Correct, some effort | Slightly increase interval |
| 3     | Correct, hard recall | Maintain or slightly raise |
| 2     | Incorrect, familiar  | Reset interval             |
| 1     | Incorrect, vague     | Reset interval             |
| 0     | Complete blackout    | Reset interval             |

Formula updates:

```python
new_ef = old_ef + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02))
```

Interval progression (in days): 1 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 21 ‚Üí 45 ‚Ä¶

## ‚úÖ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd spaced-repetition-reminder
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Python 3.11)

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* If `streamlit` or any package isn't recognized:

  * Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment
  * Check `python --version` to confirm it's Python 3.11
* For toast notifications:

  * Ensure `win10toast` is installed
  * Make sure Task Scheduler runs with user login

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* Full-fledged dashboard showing review history
* Export/import questions to JSON or CSV
* Auto backup of review database
* Desktop app version using `tkinter` or `Electron`
* Night mode and user profiles
